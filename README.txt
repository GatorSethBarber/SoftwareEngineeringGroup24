Also, I had an idea for a music application, where we can teach ear training (training people to recognize notes and intervals by ear) and how to play by ear (playing a song, then letting the user play the song on any instrument they like, then testing to see how close it is to the original song). What do you think of this idea? If you have any other ideas, please let me know.
