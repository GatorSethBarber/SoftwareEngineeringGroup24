# What We Planned

Summary Here

## Front End

Specifics here
* Create a home page accessible by registered and unregistered users allowing them to browse available gift cards.
* Create a login page and register page for users either login to their account or create a new account if they don't have one.

## Back End

Specifics here
* Design database incorporating users and gift cards
* Design and implement API to get user information (username, password, email, first and last names) based upon provided username and password.

# What We Accomplished

We designed and created the front end for logging on and signing up new users. We additionally started the front end work for viewing available gift cards. We designed and created the back ends for creating new users and accessing their information.

## Front End

Specifics here
* First
* Second

## Back End

Specifics here
* Deigned the database and created an ER diagram for it (see ERDiagram.png)
* Designed API for accessing user information and creating new standard users. Also started working on the API for the rest of the project, covering creation and accessing of gift cards, swapping gift cards, etc. The API plans are available at APIDocumentation.md.
* Implemented API so that using a URL of the form http://localhost:8080/{username}/{password} user information is returned.
* Second

# What Did not Work Out

Despite the successes we met with in Sprint 1, we did experience some serious setbacks in the implementation of the user stories.

## Front End

Specifics here
* First
* Second

## Back End

Specifics here
* First
* We were unable to implement the back end for allowing people to see which cards are available. This is primarily because doing so would require implementation of the entire database, which was temporarily put off. However, the design process for the database was completed and the design process for the API is mostly done.
