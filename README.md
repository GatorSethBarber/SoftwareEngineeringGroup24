# Project Description
## Seth's Idea
Also, I had an idea for a music application, where we can teach ear training (training people to recognize notes and intervals by ear) 
and how to play by ear (playing a song, then letting the user play the song on any instrument they like, then testing to see how close 
it is to the original song). What do you think of this idea? If you have any other ideas, please let me know.

We can have a combination of two different ideas: *apps* and *courses*:
* *apps*:     Stand alone applications, like a tuner
* *courses*: Series of activities that a user works through: For example, recognize all natural notes, 
             recognize sharps and flats, recognize common intervals, recognize chords

Database needs: Store users, store progress, deliver webpages.\
Frontend needs: Setup users, mark completion, provide training, etc.
