## Back End
### Unit Tests in Go
The testing of all functionality outside of router paths is done in Go. There are two files that contain unit tests, both of which are in src/server/
* rest_test.go: This tests the functions associated with the processing of information.
* serverAndDatabase_test.go: These tests test the functionality of the database.
### Testing the REST API
This is done through an end-to-end Cypress spec.
